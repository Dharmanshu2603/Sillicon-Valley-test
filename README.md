# Sillicon-Valley-test
Hello this is Dharmanshu Kumar,
This is my application for sillicon valley challenge.


** Please READ the following things ** :-
* I have only studied till class 48 so I don't know the concepts to be studied after that. **
* Things like asking for data which is to be provided in parent side , I haven't studied about those things. **
* Please forgive me if you find any problem/glitch/error/etc. in my code as I am just a beginner. **

About this project :--
* I created this application as I stuggeled in my life for find the best / working / safe site for a kind of work.
* I thought of parental control because these days people are facing the problem that there children are spending more than important time in devices which gets a bad effect on them.
* I also though that this could be a good application if parents want to know where there child / children is/are , and getting informed if they are at unsafe place.
